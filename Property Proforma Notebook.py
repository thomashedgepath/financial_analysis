# ## Creating a Lease Object
# 
# The below function takes the inputs of a single tenant's lease. It returns a tuple with two seperate DataFrames.
# 
# **Inputs necissary to create a Lease Object are:**
#    1. Lease Start Date
#    2. Lease End Date
#    3. Tenant's Name
#    4. Suite Number
#    5. Rental Rate PSF
#    6. Occupied SF
#    7. Expense Reimbursement Type
#    
# **The function will output a tuple with two DataFrames that can be accessed at:**
# * **_newLease.schedule_**
#     * This provides a table with complete month by month rent calculations and accounts for partial month leases
# * **_newLease.stats_**
#     * This provides general statistics about the tenant's lease including:
#         1. Tenant Name	
#         2. Suite	
#         3. Rental Rate	
#         4. SF Occupied
#         5. Total Lease Value	
#         6. Start Date	
#         7. End Date	
#         8. Number of Months	
#         9. Expense Type
# 
# Once a Lease Object is created it can be input into a Rent Roll Object along with other leases.

# ## Creating an Amortization Schedule
# 
# Creating an amortization schedule is done by calling the *amortization_table* function. This function calls on the *amortize* function to iterate through each period of the loan to calculate begining and ending balances. This is necissary to account for additional payment in excess of the required payment. Additional payments decrease the prinicpal of the loan and the interest needs to be recalculated when  
# 
# To create an amortization schedule call the *amortization_table* function using the parameters:
# 
# * **principal**: Amount borrowed
# * **interest_rate**: The annual interest rate for this loan
# * **years**: Number of years for the loan
#     
# * **annual_payments** (optional): Number of payments in a year. DEfault 12.
# * **addl_principal** (optional): Additional payments to be made each period. Default 0.
# * **start_date** (optional): Start date. Default first of next month if none provided
# 
# *amortization_table* returns a tuple with two DataFrames: 
# * **schedule**: Amortization schedule as a pandas dataframe
# * **summary**: Pandas dataframe that summarizes the payoff information
# 
# *amortization_table* passes the variables into *amortize* to iterate through and recalculate interest after additional payments have been made above the required payment.
# 
# *amortize* requires these parameters:
# 
# * **principal**: Amount borrowed
# * **interest_rate**: The annual interest rate for this loan
# * **years**: Number of years for the loan
# * **pmt**: Payment amount per period
# * **addl_principal**: Additional payments to be made each period.
# * **start_date**: Start date for the loan.
# * **annual_payments**: Number of payments in a year.
# 
# *amortize* returns:
# * **schedule**: Amortization schedule as an Ordered Dictionary
